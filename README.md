An end to end dog classification project by deep learning and transfer learning using tensorflow 2.x

# End to end Multi Class dog classification

This notebook builds an end-to-end multi-class image classifier using tensorflow 2.0 and tensorflow hub. 

## 1. Problem
Identifying the breed of a dog given an image of a dog. 

When I am sitting at the cafe and I take a photo of a dog, I want to know what breed of dog it is.

## 2. Data
The data we are using is from Kaggle's dog breed identification competition.

## 3. Evaluation
The evaluation is a file with prediction probabilities for each dog breed of each test image

## 4. Features
Some information about the data: 
* We are dating with images (unstructured data) so it is probably best we use deep learning/transfer learning.

* There are 120 breeds of dogs (this means there are 120 different classes

* There are around 10k+ images in the training set - with labels 

* There are around 10k+ images in the testing set - without labels
